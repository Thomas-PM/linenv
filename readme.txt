This directory is for backing up the virtual machine's .bashrc

This directory is shared with the host machine

Do not manually add bashrc_* files to it, as this will confuse the 'updrc' alias

Use the 'updrc' alias to add the current .bashrc file to this directory and move the old one
    To use the alias, simply type it into the terminal from any directory

There should only be one bashrc_* file in this directory, the rest of them (the older versions)
should be in the 'archive' directory
